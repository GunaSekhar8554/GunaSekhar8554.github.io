  <h1>Research</h1>
  <p>Anyone familiar with video gaming can attest to the physiological response we experience following certain in-game events: a racing heartbeat as you narrowly avoid an enemy attack or sweaty palms as you make a risky play with for a big payoff. Within gaming communities, the term "<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sweaty%20Tryhard">sweaty</a>" is even used as slang for taking the game too seriously.</p>
  <p>I'm interested in how our relationship to virtual avatars mediates our physiological reactions to events within a virtual environment; if your avatar takes damage in a video game, do you react differently depending on your relationship to that avatar?</p>

    <h2 id="msc-thesis">MSc Thesis</h2>

        How do player-avatar relationships mediate physiological responses to in-game events?
      </summary>
      <hr>
      <figure class="right">
        <img src="img/wii_boxing.gif" />
        <figcaption>Mii<sup>TM</sup> avatars from Wii Sports</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When looking at players' physiological responses to watching an avatar being beaten up in Wii Boxing<sup>TM</sup>, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093650215570652">Ratan & Dawson (2016)</a> found that they responded more when they felt emotionally connected to the avatar. So this physiological response to in-game events is affected in some way by our relationship to the avatar we are playing as.</p>

      <p><a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fppm0000170">Downs, Bowman & Banks (2017)</a> describe what they call a "Polythetic Model of Player Identification", in simple terms this means several different aspects of player-avatar relationships interacting to produce an overall experience of connectedness between player and avatar. They split player-avatar identification into six categories:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Physical Similarity</b>: How much does the avatar physically resemble you?</li>
        <li><b>Value Homophily</b>: How close are the avatar's views, background and outlook on life to your own?</li>
        <li><b>Value Homophily</b>: How close are the avatar's views, background and outlook on life to your own?</li>
        <li><b>Wishful Identification</b>: Do you wish you were more like the avatar?</li>
        <li><b>Liking</b>: Do you like the avatar?</li>
        <li><b>Perspective-Taking</b>: Can you take the avatar's perspective, sympathising with its experiences and motives?</li>
        <li><b>Embodiment</b>: Does it feel as if you are acting through the avatar, rather than merely controlling it?</li>
      </ul>


      <p>My MSc thesis research asked the following question: Which of elements of player identification are responsible for <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093650215570652">Ratan & Dawson's (2016)</a> effect?</p>

      <p>I investigated this using the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/13230/Unreal_Tournament_2004_Editors_Choice_Edition/">Unreal Tournament 2004</a><sup>TM</sup>; an action-packed first-person shooter in which players compete for "kills" and seek to avoid "deaths". My fellow <a href="http://psychtech.co.uk">technicians</a> Foivos Vantzos, Ferenc Igali and I wrote a mutator for the game; a piece of code which modifies how the game works. This mutator forces the game output two pieces of data every 0.2 seconds for the duration of gameplay: The player's current health and their number of kills. Using this data I was able to identify timestamps of when players took significant (>20%) damage and when they killed an enemy.</p>

      <p>Cross-correlating this with GSR data taken whilst playing gave a measure of how responsive players were to in-game events, both positive (kills) and negative (damage). I also asked participants to answer the same questions used by <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fppm0000170">Downs, Bowman & Banks (2017)</a> to determine in what way they relate to their chosen avatar.</p>
        
      <p>By comparing the two sets of data, responsiveness to in-game events and polythetic factors of player identification, I hope to clarify what specifically it is about human-avatar connections which affect our physiological responses to in-game events.</p>

    <h2 id="gaw2019">Games Analysis Workshop 2019</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>
        The <a href="http://game-analysis-workshop.org/">Games Analysis Workshop</a> (GAW) is a two-day workshop where a diverse selection of approaches to game analysis are applied to a single game.
      </summary>
      <hr>
      <p>I attended GAW in 2019, hosted that year by <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/">TU Delft</a>. The game in question that year was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/">No Man's Sky</a>; an open-world, procedurally-generated survival game in which you play as a stranded explorer on a hostile planet, slowly gaining new technologies and eventually blasting off to explore the galaxy.</p>

      <p>My research looks at players' biological responses to in-game events, and how these can be modulated by their relationship to their avatar. So I had brought with me a <a href="https://edulab.com/datalogging/">Neulog Edulogger</a> to measure GSR during gameplay, which I ran in MATLAB 2019, using <a href="https://github.com/UniLincolnPsychTech/Edulog">code</a> I had written in my role as a technician. This footage is from myself playing No Man's Sky, with my Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) data from the same time - both tonic (gradual) and phasic (immediate) - overlaid for side-by-side comparison.

    <h1>PsychoPy</h1>
    <p><a href="https://opensciencetools.org/#psychopy">Psychopy</a> is graphical interface for building Psychology experiments, designed to be accurate enough for publication-quality research but intuitive enough for undergraduate students. Since May of 2020, I have been working as a Python developer, improving the front-end user interface and design of PsychoPy.</p>

    <h2 id="ppy-interface">User Interface</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>One of the most noticeable changes I've helped to make is a graphical overhaul of the interface; replacing the default wx panels and outdated icons with a clean, navigable and more modern looking interface.</summary>

        </figure>
        <p>George had the idea for this research whilst watching a football game; after fast-forwarding through part of the game, he noticed that the players seemed to move slower. This seemed to be some kind of normalisation effect, akin to the Motion Aftereffect (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786443408648481">Addams, 1834</a>), whereby object appears slower / faster when returned to normal speed after being sped up / slowed down as the visual system accepts the altered speed as a "new normal".</p>

        <p>After securing funding from the ESRC, George and Rebecca began constructing experiments to test this phenomenon. However, Rebecca unfortunately had to leave the project before completion, so I was taken on as a Research Assistant for the final 9 months of the project, helping to gather data and build the final few experiments.</p>

      </header>
      <details>
        <summary>
          <p>Typora is a markdown editor, this means that users can type content as they would in generic Notepad apps and this content will be styled according to a <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">markdown syntax</a> and a customisable CSS file.</p>
        </summary>
        <hr>
        <p>Typora is easily my text editor of choice, to such an extent that it actually usurped Notepad as the default text editor on my computer. I love that it is fast, visually appealing and, most of all, customisable. As a capable CSS coder, I often create custom Typora themes for personal use. Recently, I have begun submitting these to Typora's <a href="https://github.com/typora/typora-theme-gallery">theme gallery</a>:</p>
        <h4>Whitelines</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.whitelinespaper.com/">Whitelines</a> are a make of notepad which I'm particularly fond of - rather than dark lines on a pure white page, Whitelines paper is ever so slightly grey, with lines instead drawn on in white, so that you writing and drawing stands out more on the page. Having used Whitelines paper for a number of years now, I decided to make my text editor match, creating a CSS file to style Typora markdown like a Whitelines notebook - with some personal favourite fonts. I wish I could say my handwriting is as neat as <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Didact+Gothic">Didact Gothic</a>, but sadly this theme is the closest I can get!</p>

        <h4>Torillic</h4>
        <p>I'm a big Dungeons & Dragons fan. I love tabletop roleplay in general and especially love creating stories and worlds for my friends to enjoy, so to help me create resources for running campaigns I made a Dungeons & Dragons-esque theme for Typora. Torillic uses the closest open-source fonts I could find to those used in the <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a>, making it easy to quickly whip up a professional looking stat block, character sheet or quest guide!</p>

        <p>During some of the interrim period between starting part-time as a technician and starting my Master's, I spent Mondays and Tuesdays working as a research assistant for Dr Jon Hudson and Dr Petra Pollux on their Cognitive Daisy project (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1471301216673918">Hudson and Pollux, 2016</a>). I created a manual for carers to train them in the use of the daisy, helping bridge the gap between academic understanding of neuroscience and the practical implications for care.</p>
