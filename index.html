      <details>
        <summary>
          <p>Psychopy is a Python-based builder for Psychology experiments, designed to be accurate enough for publication-quality research but intuitive enough for undergraduate students.</p>
        </summary>
        <markdown>
In May, I was hired as a Python programmer for Psychopy. Since then I have been predominantly working on a graphic overhaul of the software, updating the program's look and feel to be as slick and intuitive as its function. I also added a "dark mode" to the software - a popular feature amongst programmers as the darker colours help to reduce eyestrain during long periods of screentime.

Below are some before-and-after screenshots of the new look:

### Builder View
This is the visual interface for building experiments, showing the full experiment as a flow diagram and individual ''routines'' in a zoomed-in view, with their component parts visualised as blocks on a timeline.

![Builder Dark](http://toddparsons.co.uk/PsychopyScreenshots/Builder-Dark.png)

### Coder View
This view shows the experiments created in Builder view, but compiled into Python files. Coder view can also be used as a programming IDE, giving programmers and more advanced Psychopy users access to the powerful Psychopy libraries.

        <summary>
          <p>Typora is a markdown editor, this means that users can type content as they would in generic Notepad apps and this content will be styled according to a <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">markdown syntax</a> and a customisable CSS file.</p>
        </summary>
        <markdown>
Typora is easily my text editor of choice, to such an extent that it actually usurped Notepad as the default text editor on my computer. I love that it is fast, visually appealing and, most of all, customisable. As a capable CSS coder, I often create custom Typora themes for personal use. Recently, I have begun submitting these to Typora's [theme gallery](https://github.com/typora/typora-theme-gallery):
### Whitelines
[Whitelines](https://www.whitelinespaper.com/) are a make of notepad which I'm particularly fond of - rather than dark lines on a pure white page, Whitelines paper is ever so slightly grey, with lines instead drawn on in white, so that you writing and drawing stands out more on the page. Having used Whitelines paper for a number of years now, I decided to make my text editor match, creating a CSS file to style Typora markdown like a Whitelines notebook - with some personal favourite fonts. I wish I could say my handwriting is as neat as [Didact Gothic](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Didact+Gothic), but sadly this theme is the closest I can get!
          
![Whitelines](https://theme.typora.io/media/theme/whitelines/full.png)
You can download the Whitelines theme for Typora [here](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Whitelines/)
### Torillic
I'm a big Dungeons & Dragons fan. I love tabletop roleplay in general and especially love creating stories and worlds for my friends to enjoy, so to help me create resources for running campaigns I made a Dungeons & Dragons-esque theme for Typora. Torillic uses the closest open-source fonts I could find to those used in the [Player's Handbook](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook), making it easy to quickly whip up a professional looking stat block, character sheet or quest guide!

      <h1>Player-Avatar Relationships and Physiological Responsivity (MSc Thesis)</h1>
    </header>
    <details>
      <summary>
        <p>My thesis research looks at physiological measures of human-avatar relationships; how does a player's relationship with their avatar mediate their physiological responses to in-game events?</p>
      </summary>
      <markdown>Anyone familiar with videogaming can attest to the physiological response we experience following certain in-game events: a racing heartbeat as you narrowly avoid an enemy attack or sweaty palms as you make a risky play with for a big payoff. Within gaming communities, "[sweaty](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sweaty%20Tryhard)" is even used as slang for taking the game too seriously.

When looking at players' physiological responses to watching an avatar being beaten up in Wii Boxing^TM^, [Ratan & Dawson (2016)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093650215570652)'> found that they responded more when they felt emotionally connected to the avatar. So this physiological response to in-game events is affected in some way by our relationship to the avatar we are playing as.

[Downs, Bowman & Banks (2017)](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fppm0000170) describe what they call a "Polythetic Model of Player Identification", in simple terms this means several different aspects of player-avatar relationships interacting to produce an overall experience of connectedness between player and avatar. They split player-avatar identification into six categories:

- *Physical Similarity*: How much does the avatar physically resemble you?
- *Value Homophily*: How close are the avatar's views, background and outlook on life to your own?
- *Wishful Identification*: Do you wish you were more like the avatar?
- *Liking*: Do you like the avatar?
- *Perspective-Taking*: Can you take the avatar's perspective, sympathising with its experiences and motives?
- *Embodiment*: Does it feel as if you are acting through the avatar, rather than merely controlling it?
My thesis research asks the following question: Which of elements of player identification are responsible for [Ratan & Dawson's (2016)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093650215570652) effect?

I am investigating this using the game Unreal Tournament 2004^TM^; an action-packed first-person shooter in which players compete for "kills" and seek to avoid "deaths". My fellow [technicians](http://psychtech.co.uk) Foivos Vantzos, Ferenc Igali and I wrote a mutator for the game; a piece of code which modifies how the game works. This mutator forces the game output two pieces of data every 0.2 seconds for the duration of gameplay: The player's current health and their number of kills. Using this data I am able to identify timestamps of when players took significant (>20%) damage and when they killed an enemy. Cross-correlating this with GSR data taken whilst playing gives a measure of how responsive players were to in-game events, both positive (kills) and negative (damage). I also ask participants to answer the same questions used by [Downs, Bowman & Banks (2017)](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fppm0000170) to determine in what way they relate to their chosen avatar.
        
By comparing the two sets of data, responsiveness to in-game events and polythetic factors of player identification, I hope to clarify what specifically it is about human-avatar connections which affect our physiological responses to in-game events.

      <h1>Retinotopic Adaptation To Human Locomotion</h1>
    </header>
    <details>
      <summary>
        <p>In 2016 I was employed by Professor George Mather at the University of Lincoln as a research assistant, assisting with the final year of a collaboration between himself and Doctor Rebecca Sharman, looking at early visual processing of human locomotion.
        </p>
      </summary>
      <markdown>

George had the idea for this research whilst watching a football game; after fast-forwarding through part of the game, he noticed that the players seemed to move slower. This seemed to be some kind of normalisation effect, akin to the Motion Aftereffect ([Addams, 1834](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786443408648481)), whereby object appears slower / faster when returned to normal speed after being sped up / slowed down as the visual system accepts the altered speed as a "new normal".

After securing funding from the ESRC, George and Rebecca began constructing experiments to test this phenomenon. However, Rebecca unfortunately had to leave the project before completion, so I was taken on as a Research Assistant for the final 9 months of the project, helping to gather data and build the final few experiments.

Full details of the project can be found [here](https://gmresearch2016.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/).

        The Cognitive Daisy

    <details>
      <summary>
        <p>The Cognitive Daisy is a visual aid for carers of patients with Alzheimer's and dementia. By representing cognitive functions as coloured petails, it gives carers a comprehensive overview of their patients' capabilities at a glance.</p>
      </summary>
      <markdown>
During some of the interrim period between starting part-time as a technician and starting my Master's, I spent Mondays and Tuesdays working as a research assistant for Dr Jon Hudson and Dr Petra Pollux on their Cognitive Daisy project ([Hudson and Pollux, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1471301216673918)). I created a manual for carers to train them in the use of the daisy, helping bridge the gap between academic understanding of neuroscience and the practical implications for care.

      <h1>Games Analysis Workshop (Delft, 2019)
        </header>
      <details>
        <summary>
          <p>In 2019 I attended the Games Analysis Workshop in Delft, the concept was simple: Everyone attending worked in video game research and had some method of analysing a video game ready to go. At the beginning of the workshop, the organisers announced a game and we all applied our given method to it. This year, the game in question was No Man's Sky. </p>
        </summary>

        <markdown>My research looks at players' biological responses to in-game events, and how these can be modulated by their relationship to their avatar. So I had brought with me a [Neulog Edulogger](https://edulab.com/datalogging/) to measure GSR during gameplay. This footage is from myself playing No Man's Sky, with my GSR data from the same time - both tonic (gradual) and phasic (immediate) - overlaid for side-by-side comparison.
