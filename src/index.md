# Who am I?
I'm a Python programmer with a background in psychological research, a hobbyist web / graphic designer, a TTRPG enthusiast, and generally an all round tech nerd.

# PsychoPy

[Psychopy](https://psychopy.org) is Python library and accompanying graphical interface for building psychology experiments, designed to be accurate enough for publication-quality research but intuitive enough for undergraduate students. Since May of 2020, I have been working as a Python developer on PsychoPy - mainly focused on improving the user interface and the way PsychoPy Builder writes Python code.

# Research

Anyone familiar with video gaming can attest to the physiological response we experience following certain in-game events: a racing heartbeat as you narrowly avoid an enemy attack or sweaty palms as you make a risky play with for a big payoff. Within gaming communities, the term "[sweaty](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sweaty Tryhard)" is even used as slang for taking the game too seriously.

I'm interested in how our relationship to virtual avatars mediates our physiological reactions to events within a virtual environment; if your avatar takes damage in a video game, do you react differently depending on your relationship to that avatar?

# Other Projects

### Markmoji
Markmoji is a Python package which extends the [basic markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) using an easy to understand and quickly readable emoji-based syntax, allowing you to create custom HTML elements from just an emoji, a label and a URL. I created Markmoji for fun as a personal project, inspired mostly by needing an easy way to specify citations on this very website! You can read more about Markmoji [here](https://teparsons.github.io/Markmoji/) and you can install it via:
```
pip install markmoji
```

### Talking Jobs with Dr Rachel Bromnick
Talking Jobs is an audio podcast aimed at Psychology students, introducing them to life after uni through interviews with professionals working in Psychology. All episodes are available to listen to for free on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAlqARNMz-RzM-IO9iwb-E22X2g9k3cuC). I helped record and edit the videos, as well as [starring in one!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOEQfUlTxc4).

### Typora
Typora is a markdown editor, this means that users can type content as they would in generic Notepad apps and this content will be styled according to a [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and a customisable CSS file. I've contributed the following CSS themes to Typora:
- [Torillic](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Torillic/)
- [Krafty](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Krafty/)
- [Whitelines](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Whitelines/)
- [LCARS](https://theme.typora.io/theme/LCARS/)

### The Cognitive Daisy
[The Cognitive Daisy](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1471301216673918) is a visual aid for carers of patients with Alzheimer's and dementia. By representing cognitive functions as coloured petails, it gives carers a comprehensive overview of their patients' capabilities at a glance. I worked on the project as a research assistant, helping develop a guide for carers to understand the science behind the daisy.
