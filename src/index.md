# Who am I?
I'm a Python programmer with a background in psychological research, a hobbyist web / graphic designer, a TTRPG enthusiast, and generally an all round tech nerd.

# PsychoPy

[Psychopy](https://psychopy.org) is Python library and accompanying graphical interface for building psychology experiments, designed to be accurate enough for publication-quality research but intuitive enough for undergraduate students. Since May of 2020, I have been working as a Python developer on PsychoPy - mainly focused on improving the user interface and the way PsychoPy Builder writes Python code.

# Research

Anyone familiar with video gaming can attest to the physiological response we experience following certain in-game events: a racing heartbeat as you narrowly avoid an enemy attack or sweaty palms as you make a risky play with for a big payoff. Within gaming communities, the term "[sweaty](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sweaty Tryhard)" is even used as slang for taking the game too seriously.

I'm interested in how our relationship to virtual avatars mediates our physiological reactions to events within a virtual environment; if your avatar takes damage in a video game, do you react differently depending on your relationship to that avatar?

# Other Projects

## CSS Themes
As you may be able to tell from this website, I enjoy making CSS themes. It gives me an outlet for my inherent aesthetic snobbery, I find it relaxing making minor tweaks to the spacing of such-and-such element to get a page rendering exactly how I want it.

### Torillic

![Torillic](articles/torillic/full.png)

Torillic is designed to look like the official material for Dungeons & Dragons, I use it to write notes for my TTRPG campaigns and to style them once compiled and hosted to wiki-style websites.

### LCARS

![LCARS](articles/lcars/full.png)

LCARS is designed to look like the fictional LCARS operating system from Star Trek. Like Torillic, I like to use it for TTRPG campaign notes, but in this case the more sci-fi adjacent settings.

### Whitelines

![Whitelines](articles/whitelines/full.png)

Whitelines is the theme I use most in my day-to-day markdown editing. It's designed to look like [Whitelines](https://www.whitelinespaper.com/) notepads, which (being a stationery nerd) are my favourite kind of notebook to write on. So it only makes sense to edit markdown on the same kind of paper!

## Python GUI

Working with a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) at Open Science Tools gives me a thorough familiarity with the GUI packages used in Python, sometimes I find myself wishing for certain widgets to exist so in my free time I go ahead and make them.

### `pygments-gui`
`pygments-gui` is a plugin for [Pygments](https://pygments.org/), a Python package which takes code and applies syntactic styling to it. The plugin adds classes and methods for using Pygments within a GUI, styling the contents of text controls live in a fast and efficient way.

You can find `pygments-gui` on GitHub [here](https://github.com/TEParsons/pygments-gui).
