# How Do Player-Avatar Relationships Mediate Physiological Responses To In-Game Events?

When looking at players' physiological responses to watching an avatar being beaten up in Wii BoxingTM, [Ratan & Dawson (2016)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093650215570652) found that they responded more when they felt emotionally connected to the avatar. So this physiological response to in-game events is affected in some way by our relationship to the avatar we are playing as.

[Downs, Bowman & Banks (2017)](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fppm0000170) describe what they call a "Polythetic Model of Player Identification", in simple terms this means several different aspects of player-avatar relationships interacting to produce an overall experience of connectedness between player and avatar. They split player-avatar identification into six categories:

- **Physical Similarity**: How much does the avatar physically resemble you?
- **Value Homophily**: How close are the avatar's views, background and outlook on life to your own?
- **Value Homophily**: How close are the avatar's views, background and outlook on life to your own?
- **Wishful Identification**: Do you wish you were more like the avatar?
- **Liking**: Do you like the avatar?
- **Perspective-Taking**: Can you take the avatar's perspective, sympathising with its experiences and motives?
- **Embodiment**: Does it feel as if you are acting through the avatar, rather than merely controlling it?

My MSc thesis research asked the following question: Which of elements of player identification are responsible for [Ratan & Dawson's (2016)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093650215570652) effect?

I investigated this using the game [Unreal Tournament 2004](https://store.steampowered.com/app/13230/Unreal_Tournament_2004_Editors_Choice_Edition/)TM; an action-packed first-person shooter in which players compete for "kills" and seek to avoid "deaths". My fellow [technicians](http://psychtech.co.uk) Foivos Vantzos, Ferenc Igali and I wrote a mutator for the game; a piece of code which modifies how the game works. This mutator forces the game output two pieces of data every 0.2 seconds for the duration of gameplay: The player's current health and their number of kills. Using this data I was able to identify timestamps of when players took significant (>20%) damage and when they killed an enemy.

Cross-correlating this with GSR data taken whilst playing gave a measure of how responsive players were to in-game events, both positive (kills) and negative (damage). I also asked participants to answer the same questions used by [Downs, Bowman & Banks (2017)](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fppm0000170) to determine in what way they relate to their chosen avatar.

By comparing the two sets of data, responsiveness to in-game events and polythetic factors of player identification, I hope to clarify what specifically it is about human-avatar connections which affect our physiological responses to in-game events.
