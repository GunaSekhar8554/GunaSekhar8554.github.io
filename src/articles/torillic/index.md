Torillic came out of me wanting to use markdown to write notes for my TTRPG campaigns; I'd found the markdown editor [Typora](https://typora.io/) and loved that it lets you write your own custom themes in CSS, so I set about making something which looks like the official resources for Dungeons & Dragons.

You can view/download the Typora theme [here](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Torillic/), below are some previews of how it looks in Typora:
