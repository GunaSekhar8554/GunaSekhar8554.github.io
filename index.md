## Player-Avatar Relationships and Physiological Responsivity (MSc Thesis)
My thesis research looks at physiological measures of human-avatar relationships; how does a player's relationship with their avatar mediate their physiological responses to in-game events?

Anyone familiar with videogaming can attest to the physiological response we experience following certain in-game events: a racing heartbeat as you narrowly avoid an enemy attack or sweaty palms as you make a risky play with for a big payoff. Within gaming communities, "[sweaty](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sweaty%20Tryhard)" is even used as slang for taking the game too seriously.

When looking at players' physiological responses to watching an avatar being beaten up in Wii BoxingTM, [Ratan & Dawson (2016)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093650215570652) found that they responded more when they felt emotionally connected to the avatar. So this physiological response to in-game events is affected in some way by our relationship to the avatar we are playing as.

[Downs, Bowman & Banks (2017)](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fppm0000170) describe what they call a Polythetic Model of Player Identification, in simple terms this means several different aspects of player-avatar relationships interacting to produce an overall experience of connectedness between player and avatar. They split player-avatar identification into six categories:

#### Physical Similarity
How much does the avatar physically resemble you?
#### Value Homophily
How close are the avatar's views, background and outlook on life to your own?
#### Wishful Identification
Do you wish you were more like the avatar?
#### Liking
Do you like the avatar?
#### Perspective-Taking
Can you take the avatar's perspective, sympathising with its experiences and motives?
#### Embodiment
Does it feel as if you are acting through the avatar, rather than merely controlling it?
My thesis research asks the following question: Which of elements of player identification are responsible for Ratan & Dawson's (2016) effect?

I am investigating this using the game Unreal Tournament 2004<sup>TM</sup>; an action-packed first-person shooter in which players compete for "kills" and seek to avoid "deaths". My fellow [technicians](http://psychtech.co.uk/) Foivos Vantzos, Ferenc Igali and I wrote a mutator for the game; a piece of code which modifies how the game works. This mutator forces the game output two pieces of data every 0.2 seconds for the duration of gameplay: The player's current health and their number of kills. Using this data I am able to identify timestamps of when players took significant (>20%) damage and when they killed an enemy. Cross-correlating this with GSR data taken whilst playing gives a measure of how responsive players were to in-game events, both positive (kills) and negative (damage). I also ask participants to answer the same questions used by [Downs, Bowman & Banks (2017)](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fppm0000170) to determine in what way they relate to their chosen avatar.

By comparing the two sets of data, responsiveness to in-game events and polythetic factors of player identification, I hope to clarify what specifically it is about human-avatar connections which affect our physiological responses to in-game events.

## Retinotopic Adaptation To Human Locomotion
In 2016 I was employed by Professor George Mather at the University of Lincoln as a research assistant, assisting with the final year of a collaboration between himself and Doctor Rebecca Sharman, looking at early visual processing of human locomotion.

George had the idea for this research whilst watching a football game; after fast-forwarding through part of the game, he noticed that the players seemed to move slower. This seemed to be some kind of normalisation effect, akin to the Motion Aftereffect ([Addams, 1834](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786443408648481)), whereby object appears slower / faster when returned to normal speed after being sped up / slowed down as the visual system accepts the altered speed as a "new normal".

After securing funding from the ESRC, George and Rebecca began constructing experiments to test this phenomenon. However, Rebecca unfortunately had to leave the project before completion, so I was taken on as a Research Assistant for the final 9 months of the project, helping to gather data and build the final few experiments.

Full details of the project can be found [here](https://gmresearch2016.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/).

## The Cognitive Daisy
The Cognitive Daisy is a visual aid for carers of patients with Alzheimer's and dementia. By representing cognitive functions as coloured petails, it gives carers a comprehensive overview of their patients' capabilities at a glance.

During some of the interrim period between starting part-time as a technician and starting my Master's, I spent Mondays and Tuesdays working as a research assistant for Dr Jon Hudson and Dr Petra Pollux on their Cognitive Daisy project ([Hudson and Pollux, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1471301216673918)). I created a manual for carers to train them in the use of the daisy, helping bridge the gap between academic understanding of neuroscience and the practical implications for care.
