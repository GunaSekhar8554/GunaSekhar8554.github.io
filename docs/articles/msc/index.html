    <p>When looking at players' physiological responses to watching an avatar being beaten up in Wii BoxingTM, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093650215570652">Ratan &amp; Dawson (2016)</a> found that they responded more when they felt emotionally connected to the avatar. So this physiological response to in-game events is affected in some way by our relationship to the avatar we are playing as.</p>
<p><a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fppm0000170">Downs, Bowman &amp; Banks (2017)</a> describe what they call a "Polythetic Model of Player Identification", in simple terms this means several different aspects of player-avatar relationships interacting to produce an overall experience of connectedness between player and avatar. They split player-avatar identification into six categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Similarity</strong>: How much does the avatar physically resemble you?</li>
<li><strong>Value Homophily</strong>: How close are the avatar's views, background and outlook on life to your own?</li>
<li><strong>Value Homophily</strong>: How close are the avatar's views, background and outlook on life to your own?</li>
<li><strong>Wishful Identification</strong>: Do you wish you were more like the avatar?</li>
<li><strong>Liking</strong>: Do you like the avatar?</li>
<li><strong>Perspective-Taking</strong>: Can you take the avatar's perspective, sympathising with its experiences and motives?</li>
<li><strong>Embodiment</strong>: Does it feel as if you are acting through the avatar, rather than merely controlling it?</li>
</ul>
<p>My MSc thesis research asked the following question: Which of elements of player identification are responsible for <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093650215570652">Ratan &amp; Dawson's (2016)</a> effect?</p>
<p>I investigated this using the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/13230/Unreal_Tournament_2004_Editors_Choice_Edition/">Unreal Tournament 2004</a>TM; an action-packed first-person shooter in which players compete for "kills" and seek to avoid "deaths". My fellow <a href="http://psychtech.co.uk">technicians</a> Foivos Vantzos, Ferenc Igali and I wrote a mutator for the game; a piece of code which modifies how the game works. This mutator forces the game output two pieces of data every 0.2 seconds for the duration of gameplay: The player's current health and their number of kills. Using this data I was able to identify timestamps of when players took significant (&gt;20%) damage and when they killed an enemy.</p>
<p>Cross-correlating this with GSR data taken whilst playing gave a measure of how responsive players were to in-game events, both positive (kills) and negative (damage). I also asked participants to answer the same questions used by <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fppm0000170">Downs, Bowman &amp; Banks (2017)</a> to determine in what way they relate to their chosen avatar.</p>
<p>By comparing the two sets of data, responsiveness to in-game events and polythetic factors of player identification, I hope to clarify what specifically it is about human-avatar connections which affect our physiological responses to in-game events.</p>
