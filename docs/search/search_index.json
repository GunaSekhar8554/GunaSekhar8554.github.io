Research Anyone familiar with video gaming can attest to the physiological response we experience following certain in-game events: a racing heartbeat as you narrowly avoid an enemy attack or sweaty palms as you make a risky play with for a big payoff. Within gaming communities, the term \" sweaty \" is even used as slang for taking the game too seriously. I'm interested in how our relationship to virtual avatars mediates our physiological reactions to events within a virtual environment; if your avatar takes damage in a video game, do you react differently depending on your relationship to that avatar?

The game in question that year was No Man's Sky ; an open-world, procedurally-generated survival game in which you play as a stranded explorer on a hostile planet, slowly gaining new technologies and eventually blasting off to explore the galaxy. My research looks at players' biological responses to in-game events, and how these can be modulated by their relationship to their avatar. So I had brought with me a Neulog Edulogger to measure GSR during gameplay, which I ran in MATLAB 2019, using code I had written in my role as a technician. This footage is from myself playing No Man's Sky, with my Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) data from the same time - both tonic (gradual) and phasic (immediate) - overlaid for side-by-side comparison. Footage from the workshop. I'm playing No Man's Sky whilst measuring my GSR.","title":"Gaw2019"},{"location":"articles/msc/","text":"When looking at players' physiological responses to watching an avatar being beaten up in Wii BoxingTM, Ratan & Dawson (2016) found that they responded more when they felt emotionally connected to the avatar. So this physiological response to in-game events is affected in some way by our relationship to the avatar we are playing as. Downs, Bowman & Banks (2017) describe what they call a \"Polythetic Model of Player Identification\", in simple terms this means several different aspects of player-avatar relationships interacting to produce an overall experience of connectedness between player and avatar. They split player-avatar identification into six categories: Physical Similarity : How much does the avatar physically resemble you? Value Homophily : How close are the avatar's views, background and outlook on life to your own? Value Homophily : How close are the avatar's views, background and outlook on life to your own? Wishful Identification : Do you wish you were more like the avatar? Liking : Do you like the avatar? Perspective-Taking : Can you take the avatar's perspective, sympathising with its experiences and motives? Embodiment : Does it feel as if you are acting through the avatar, rather than merely controlling it? My MSc thesis research asked the following question: Which of elements of player identification are responsible for Ratan & Dawson's (2016) effect? I investigated this using the game Unreal Tournament 2004 TM; an action-packed first-person shooter in which players compete for \"kills\" and seek to avoid \"deaths\". My fellow technicians Foivos Vantzos, Ferenc Igali and I wrote a mutator for the game; a piece of code which modifies how the game works. This mutator forces the game output two pieces of data every 0.2 seconds for the duration of gameplay: The player's current health and their number of kills. Using this data I was able to identify timestamps of when players took significant (>20%) damage and when they killed an enemy. Cross-correlating this with GSR data taken whilst playing gave a measure of how responsive players were to in-game events, both positive (kills) and negative (damage). I also asked participants to answer the same questions used by Downs, Bowman & Banks (2017) to determine in what way they relate to their chosen avatar. By comparing the two sets of data, responsiveness to in-game events and polythetic factors of player identification, I hope to clarify what specifically it is about human-avatar connections which affect our physiological responses to in-game events.","title":"Msc"},{"location":"articles/psychopy/","text":"User Interface One of the most noticeable changes I've helped to make is a graphical overhaul of the interface; replacing the default wx panels and outdated icons with a clean, navigable and more modern looking interface.
